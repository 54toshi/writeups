# Babel
## Instructions
It's babel! Just a bunch of gibberish, right?

## solve
deobfuscate the C# code and print out the decoded part as seen in my example babel_decode.cs.
compile
```
sudo apt install mono-mcs
mcs program.cs
mono program.exe
```
the flag will be in plaintext between the jibberish, which appears to be an executable.
